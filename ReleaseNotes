- Wiki Forms

- Page Filters (including SpamFilter)

- Muchos enhanced WeblogPlugin

- Style support using the %%-directive

- Easier templates

- The default template now validates as XHTML 1.0 Transitional

- Page variables (see SET-directive), also accessible on pages

- Caching attachment provider integrated

- OSCache integration

- Printer-friendly stylesheet for the default template

- Multiple Wikis with a single WAR-file -support.

UPGRADE NOTES
=============

Upgrading from 2.0:

* Please reinstall in a new directory.  Then move your modified
  templates into the new templates/ -directory.  You MUST
  have the default template in place, else things might not
  work.
* Replace jspwiki.properties with your old configuration file.
  It should run unmodified, though you might want to go through
  the new file to see new options.

Upgrading from earlier installations:

* Please make a complete reinstall.  Your wiki pages will still be
  compatible, and the configuration for the most part.

KNOWN MAJOR ISSUES
==================

* Documentation needs cleanup; parts of it are out of date, etc.

          standard Java System properties.

NEW FEATURES SINCE 2.6.x
========================

* JSPWiki now requires JDK 1.5 to run.

* Simplified Chinese, Dutch, Italian and Russian localizations added!

* There is no more need for JAAS files!  Hooray!  This has
  been replaced with custom jspwiki properties.  Please see
  the UPGRADING document.

* Massive improvements to the default template, like
  section editing.
  
* Sneak preview in the default editor

* WikiWizard is removed (it is LGPL), but FCK integration is available,
  and WikiWizard can still be installed as a separate package.

UPGRADE NOTES

EXPERIMENTAL FEATURES
=====================

There are some features in this release which could mostly be considered
<<<<<<< HEAD
experimental at best.  The following ones are known to work only 
partially:

* Atom support.  We can give out feeds in Atom 0.3, but it's not really
  tested properly.  There's also preliminary APP support, but it does 
  not work.
  
* WYSIWYG editing.  You need to install FCK by yourself.  It sort of
  works, but not quite.
  
* Install.jsp.  It's still a bit experimental, though it should work...

* WebDAV support.  This is known to be broken on pretty many levels...

* XHTML -> WikiMarkup translation.  Spotty, but should work for the most
  part.
  

NOTE ABOUT AUTHENTICATION
=========================

This JSPWiki version includes an unsupported version of Authorization
and Authentication.  AAA was supposed to be the major feature of the
2.2 release, but unfortunately it turned out that the solution chosen
was crappy and the coder (me) did not know what he was doing.  This
dragged the work for the 2.2 release behind for many months, as I was
not really interested in doing it.  So I decided to discard the entire
solution and settle for something simpler.  This work is still
ongoing, and a new solution is being drafted.

The old auth system is still in place, but it is completely deprecated
and largely undocumented.  You may use it if you want, but please do
not report any bugs regarding it.  You can enable it by putting
"jspwiki.auth.useOldAuth=true" in your jspwiki.properties.
=======
experimental at best.  The following ones are known to work only
partially:

* WebDAV support.  This is known to be broken on pretty many levels...

* Admin interface.  Check out /admin/Admin.jsp.

KNOWN PROBLEMS
==============

* WebDAV does not yet support the new authentication/permissions scheme.
  Therefore, if you have very sensitive data in your wiki, you might not want
  to enable it.

* Not all old plugins work.  Specifically any plugins, which construct 
  new WikiPages will fail because of the constructor has been changed.

* The PageFilter API was changed in 2.6

* Our documentation simply sucks at this point.  Please forgive us,
  and point where those fixes are needed.  We will improve upon
  based your input.

* The ShortURLConstructor does not work reliably.  Please use
  ShortViewURLConstructor, or Apache mod_rewrite.

* Running with a security manager isn't yet supported (see JSPWIKI-129).
